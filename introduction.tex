\section{\textbf{Introduction}}

The purpose of this report is to identify two electives for each major that will best complement a given studentâ€™s study in Computer Science, Information Systems, and Data Science. The report will first outline the major allocations between our four group members - Jae Hyeon (Jacob) Lee, Mia Childers, and Christian Gallant - with a brief explanation. Then, recommendations of two electives will be made for each major; this recommendation will be individually written by the allocated member with relevant justifications and investigations. More specifically, the chosen electives will be justified as to how they are connected to the domain allocated in the previous section, and connected with the relevant content of the chosen electives. Finally, the report is finalised with an extended contribution section and bibliography. 

The final elective selections for the respective majors is as follows: Jacob will elaborate on the electives QBUS1040 and ARIN1001; Christian will elaborate on electives QBUS2810 and ENGG1850; Mia will elaborate on electives GEGE2001 and BCNB2001.
