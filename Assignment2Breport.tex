\section{\textbf{Data Science - Electives}}

Before the consideration of what electives will be beneficial when completing the Data Science major, it is of paramount importance to understand what is being studied. Because the business world is becoming more digitalised, online data has increased exponentially for businesses - due to this vast amount of data, compiling and analysing such information has become imperative to the success of the given industry. Thus, the domain of data science constitutes an evaluation of data in order to identify unseen patterns, derivation of critical information for the business, creation of visualisations that can be interpreted and analysed accordingly, and manifestations of predictive models that will assist business decisions (Simplilearn, 2021 and University of Sydney, 2021). 


With this prerequisite knowledge, then, the one potential selection of an elective should be centered around statistical analysis and critical thinking; the major itself is focused on organising relevant data and analysing such figures for the future success of an organisation. Furthermore, another selection of an elective should be focused on the contextual implementation of data science as a domain of application. Compared to the other domains such as computer science and cybersecurity, the field of data science is heavily based on organising and analysing existing data - while the creation of programs dedicated towards such operations are part of the field (similar to computer science or software development), it is focused more heavily on how large data sets can be interpreted to assist business decisions in the future. Thus, it is a field of study that is continuing to appeal to the sustainable growth within companies - according to the Harvard Business Review, professionals who are exploring this large world of data are in major demand (Davenport, Patil, 2012). Needless to say, success in the Data Science major is largely dependent on understanding how technology is evolving, adapting, and being utilised by current organisations. Conclusively, the two chosen electives should develop two areas while studying the major of Data Science: first, the critical thinking and analytical side of Data Science for practical skill development; second, a contextual knowledge of technology and Data Science as a whole so the student can effectively utilise their aforementioned skill-sets in the real-world.


The first elective that will complement the study of Data Science is \textit{QBUS1040: Foundations of Business Analytics} (University of Sydney, 2021). The aforementioned elective is a unit focused on formulating a base for the student studying a Business Analytics major - in addition to teaching linear algebra and calculus for the handling of multiple variables and creating regression models, theory is covered by discussing models in real-life business contexts. Key ideas of optimisation in statistical estimates are covered, as well as basic program utilisation through languages such as Python (University of Sydney, 2021). 


Despite being a commerce elective, there is an immediate connection with the Data Science major - the basic practice of using different analytic programs will form a foundation for the student who is pursuing an Advanced Computing degree. While the coverage of program functionality and implementation is not as detailed as the computing electives, QBUS1040 serves as a sufficient reinforcement - because the aforementioned unit has a specific focus on analytics, the practical programming skills will be geared towards development in the Data Science major. 


Furthermore, the mathematical computation and practice within QBUS1040 provides an amazing opportunity for critical thinking development. An obvious complement to the Data Science major is that mathematics will lead to important knowledge regarding the plotting and visualisation of data. For example, when creating regression models, the student will be ahead in terms of understanding what variables need to be compared, what the data points actually mean, and how to effectively create graphical models of the said data values. Furthermore, practice in the subject of mathematics will improve the student’s critical thinking abilities - a trait important in the field of Data Science. In mathematics, proven rules and theorems are applied in more complex, extensive problems to derive a solution (Cheng, 2015). Consequently, critical thinking is essential when developing mathematical skills as the obtained knowledge of functions, operations, etc. can be applied and utilised to derive a final solution, regardless of the complexity of the problem. Thus, a quintessential connection between the domain of Data Science and critical thinking lies in the definitions between the two terms. Critical thinking is defined as reflective and reasonable thinking that is independently derived based on given information (Ennis, 1985). While the term itself is very broad and has a plethora of implementations, the focal point of critical thinking we are examining is the application of available information to ultimately analyse and derive a solution. Because the Data Science major is based on understanding and deriving key information from a database of numerous figures, an immediate connection can be made: if the student’s critical thinking skills are highly developed, the individual can identify methods of organising the said database into a compact, efficient manner. Naturally, then, development of critical thinking will lead to success when studying the Data Science major.


In addition to its foundational knowledge, QBUS1040 is a unit that will inevitably lead to a second-year elective named QBUS2810: a business analytics elective that continues from QBUS1040, facilitating the student’s knowledge in statistical analysis and delivering new statistical model creation methods (University of Sydney, 2021). Evidently, QBUS1040 is an elective unit that provides a strong grounding for a given student studying in the Data Science major, as their critical thinking and programming skills are established for future success. However, another key capability that the aforementioned elective provides is its continuity throughout the student’s university studies - in addition to QBUS2810, the student can continue to become more knowledgeable in statistical methods, measures, and practical application practices while taking the required computing units. 


To facilitate knowledge on technological trends and digital media, another elective that will complement the Data Science major is \textit{ARIN1001: The Past and Futures of Digital Cultures} (University of Sydney, 2021). Under this elective, the focus is mainly on digital culture: how technology is shaping society and interactions between individuals (gdsgroup, 2021), while also investigating the history, platforms, and ideas that shape technological trends. As mentioned before, the Data Science major is the study of how programs can be utilised to organise data - by understanding the bigger idea of technology, then, the student can place Data Science in a real-world context. While it may seem rudimentary, contextual knowledge is critical in constructing meaning based on individual reflection and experiences, while also applying one’s acquired skill-sets and knowledge (jbcnschool, 2019). For example, the student studying Data Science may memorise all the statistical calculation methods and programming syntax, but find trouble when placed in an actual organisation where real-life scenarios are constantly evolving. Naturally, understanding the contextual knowledge will also provide meaning to studying the major as a whole - it accentuates why the major is imperative in business success, what preparations may be needed to succeed in the near future, and why specific key operations are typically conducted within Data Science as a domain of application.


In ARIN1001, perhaps the most appealing learning outcome is within the technological trends that can be examined. Within the Data Science field, programs such as Tableau Software, Python, and Excel are continually appealing their benefits to businesses to allow for more efficient, effective data organisation. Additionally, as the business world is transitioning into a digital age where almost all transactions and business operations are conducted online, the success of a business is largely based on online consumer trends (business, 2021). Successful firms, then, will capitalise on key information that are relevant for technological success through methods such as effective online marketing, market affiliates, etc. Thus, the benefit of taking ARIN1001 is two-fold: not only will the student be more knowledgeable about digital advancements, but they will also be aware of what specific data and trends can be analysed and taken advantage of in the real-world. 


ARIN1001 can also be pursued throughout the student’s university career as an elective stream. For example, ARIN1001 can extend to ARIN3610: a third-year unit focused on how technology can influence social class, culture, identity, and digital media as a whole (University of Sydney, 2021). Needless to say, if the student decides to pursue this elective stream, the individual will be highly knowledgeable about the direction of technology in the future, its influence in the real-world context, and how they can utilise such ideas in future data analysis and/or business growth. 


In regards to how the aforementioned electives will assist in a student’s professional career, ARIN1001 and QBUS1040 are selected due to the strong foundational base they create. Assuming that the student studying the Data Science major is in their first year, the success of the student’s performance will be largely dependent on how they can apply core theories in practical scenarios. Consequently, since electives are taken in tandem with the main computing units such as INFO1110, the additional units should serve as reinforced knowledge in the Advanced Computing degree they are pursuing. QBUS1040 provides critical thinking development and basic data analysis tool training, which will complement the introductory computing units - in addition to basic syntax and program functionality, the student will have added knowledge on how they can apply such learning outcomes in the context of the Data Science Major. Furthermore, by studying ARIN1001 the student will understand the underpinning concepts of technology; thus, future studies are placed in context and applied in a meaningful way. Ultimately, while the electives may not have an immediate impact on the student’s professional career, the long-term growth that the student can achieve by taking the QBUS1040 and ARIN1001 will be exponentially higher than other Data Science students who are not genuinely knowledgeable in these areas. 


\section{\textbf{Computer Science - Electives}}

My chosen electives are GEGE20021 (Genetics and Genomic) and BCMB2001 (Biochemistry and Molecular Biology). My degree involves both a major in Computer Science and in Medical Science so these electives will be crucial to me developing an understanding of genetic and biomolecular research to further my studies. Computer Science supplements this research as a thorough understanding of data representation using Python and other coding languages, as well as imaging software such as Unity, are very important to a medical career.

These electives are second year introductory subjects and as such are fundamental to building an understanding of genetic and biomolecular research. Specifically, both majors focus a great deal on the cellular processes of mitosis and meiosis, as well as the mutations which may occur in each phase. Given the role of mutations in disease, assessing the randomness of these mutations as well as confounding factors may give substantial progress in the medical field; this is where my Computer Science major will complement these electives, as study in mathematical phenomena such as randomness, correlation and causation are incredibly useful in my chosen industry.
