\section{\textbf{Major Allocations}}

Major allocations were made based on the previous project 1, as each member has been determined through relevant comparative analyses; in addition, the when we were allocated to a given domain of application, we conducted meaningful research into the major - thus, each member is most knowledgeable in the major they were assigned in project 1. Thus, the final major allocations are as follows: Mia Childers for Computer Science, Jacob Lee for Data Science, Christian Gallant for Information Systems, and Nicholas Symons for Cybersecruity.
