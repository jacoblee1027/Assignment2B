(main) Introduction
The purpose of this report is to identify two electives for each major that will best complement a given studentâ€™s study in Computer Science, Information Systems, Data Science, and Cybersecurity. The report will first outline the major allocations between our four group members - Jae Hyeon (Jacob) Lee, Mia Childers, Nicholas Symons, and Christian Gallant - with a brief explanation. Then, recommendations of two electives will be made for each major; this recommendation will be individually written by the allocated member with relevant justifications and investigations. Finally, the report is finalised with an extended contribution section and bibliography. 

The final elective selections for the respective majors is as follows:

Major Allocations
Major allocations were made based on the previous project 1, as each member has been determined through relevant comparative analyses; in addition, the when we were allocated to a given domain of application, we conducted meaningful research into the major - thus, each member is most knowledgeable in the major they were assigned in project 1. Thus, the final major allocations are as follows: Mia Childers for Computer Science, Jacob Lee for Data Science, Christian Gallant for Information Systems, and Nicholas Symons for Cybersecruity.
